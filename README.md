# Product rating system

This is a system that rates a product using customer reviews and comments posted on any social media site. 
For now, it just only focusing on Twitter feeds. Users can use this system to track specific products of yours or
search for available products to see the ratings for the particular product.

How this works

First, we have to run the data mining module to collect the data for the given products which are stored in the Database and rate them using Natural Language Processing. Then store those data in the Database.

Now user can search for a particular product name using the client application and get the rating as:

1. How many percentages of customer comments or reviews collected are <b>Negative</b>
2. How many percentages of customer comments or reviews collected are <b>Neutral</b>
3. How many percentages of customer comments or reviews collected are <b>Positive</b>
